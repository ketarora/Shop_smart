ShopSmart AI — Your Intelligent Shopping Companion

ShopSmart AI is a privacy-first Chrome extension that empowers users to make smarter, more sustainable, and trustworthy shopping decisions.
It leverages Google’s built-in AI to instantly analyze product pages, detect fake reviews, and evaluate environmental impact — all processed locally within the browser to ensure complete privacy.

The extension offers two intelligent analysis modes:

EcoScore: Evaluates a product’s sustainability, materials, and environmental footprint.

Trust Score: Detects fake reviews and measures product reliability before purchase.

Core Features

Dual-Mode AI Analysis: Toggle between EcoScore and Trust Score for deep product insights.

Real-Time Scoring: Instantly view product scores through an interactive on-page badge.

Transparent AI Explanations: Understand why each product received its score.

Fake Review Detection: Uses linguistic and behavioral pattern analysis to detect manipulation.

Sustainability Insights: Breaks down product materials, certifications, and brand ethics.

Privacy by Design: All AI processing is local, powered by Gemini Nano — no data leaves your browser.

Offline Performance: Intelligent caching ensures smooth, fast operation even without internet.

Cross-Platform Compatibility: Works seamlessly with major e-commerce platforms such as Amazon and Flipkart.

Why It Matters

Online shopping is increasingly filled with fake reviews, greenwashing, and hidden environmental costs.
ShopSmart AI solves this by offering fact-based, AI-driven insights directly within your shopping journey.

Developed for the Google Chrome Built-in AI Challenge 2025, ShopSmart AI demonstrates the potential of on-device AI — combining privacy, speed, and transparency in a way that traditional cloud-based AI cannot.
By running entirely on Gemini Nano, it ensures real-time performance without sacrificing user data or ethics.
